## Built with

The languages and tool I used for this project are:

- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

## My Contributions to this project

- I first Folked the repl from [Replit](https://replit.com/@CFCurriculum/jQuery-to-do-list)

- I then converted all the vanilla JavaScript to JQuery

- The app was adding a task only if the user clicked the add button but I also added some functionality to the project by allowing the user to use the Enter key as well.

* The app had alternate background color on rows. However, if the use deleted a task the background color was not alternating properly. I therefore fixed this and I am very proud of my contribution.
